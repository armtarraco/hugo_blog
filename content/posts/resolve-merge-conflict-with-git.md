Resolving the conflict  
1\. Make sure you're in your repository directory.  
2\. Check out and pull the most recent version of the destination (development) branch from the remote.  
3\. Check out the source (new-branch) branch.  
4\. Merge the destination branch into the new-names branch.  
5\. Open the file and resolve the conflict. You can do this using the command line or you can navigate to the file.   
6\. Resolve the conflict  
7\. Add and commit the change.  
8\. Push the change to the remote.  
9\. Check your pull request (if you are working within a pull request) and you should see the conflicts resolved but the pull request still open.
